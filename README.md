# Mail App Simulator :)

Loads the list of emails from a static JSON file and displays them in UI. Super fast, super functional, super useful! You can even delete an "email" and happily find it in the trash folder. Persisting the changes will probably be added in the next major release. 

Built with React/Redux, Electron, and Ant Design UI.

## Get up and running

To continue the development, you need to start the HTTP server and run the electron in two different terminal windows:

1. `npm run start`
2. `npm run electron`

Have fun! :)
